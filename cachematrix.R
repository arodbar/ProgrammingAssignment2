## Make a cachable inverse function of a matrix
##

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the solve
## get the value of the solve
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getsolve <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setsolve = setsolve,
         getsolve = getsolve)
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if 
## the inverse has already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse 
## from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates 
## the inverse of the data and sets the value of the inverse in the 
## cache via the setsolve function.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    m <- x$getsolve()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setsolve(m)
    m
}
